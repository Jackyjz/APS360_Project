Penalty kicks are among soccer's most critical and high-pressure moments, as they always determine the outcomes of tightly contested matches. Our team sees the potential applications in performance analysis, coaching and real-time strategy in the ability to predict the result of a penalty kick - goal or miss. Deep learning is an appropriate and powerful tool for this task because it excels at learning complex, high-dimensional patterns from raw visual data. In this project, our deep learning model analyzes short video clips of penalty kicks, including the pre-kick body language and readiness of both the kicker and goalkeeper and predicts the probability of scoring based on the kicker's shooting directions, left, middle, and right. To focus on the relevant players, we use the YOLO object detection model to identify and crop the kicker and goalkeeper. These focused frames are then processed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial features. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) then processes the sequence of extracted features to capture how the interactions between players evolve over time. By training on real penalty scenarios, the model can identify patterns that distinguish high-probability scoring conditions from less favourable ones based on dynamic interactions between the player and the goalkeeper.
